**Author:** _devlinman_
## About Whatsit

- A lightweight, native desktop client for WhatsApp Web built with `Qt 6` and `Qt WebEngine`, and is **NOT** Electron-based.

- I have tried many Whatsapp web clients, but none of them are fast and light. None of them felt right...

- My setup is Arch-KDE Plasma-Wayland. If your setup is similar, the app should work well.

- In `v3.x.x`, additional features such as memory kill switch and custom app and tray icons, etc. You may call these features bloat, but I like to have those. If you don't want those, use lower versions of the app.

- If you want the minimal and bare version, use `v1.0.1`. Tray icon and Notifications are implemented in `v2.0.0`.

### Features

- Native Qt 6 & Qt WebEngine-based
- Persistent login and chat storage
- Uses standard XDG directories
- KDE / Wayland friendly
- KDE Native Notification support
- Reduce memory usage & kill switch
- Opens whatsapp links from browsers to send messages
- Tray icon indicator for new messages
