* About Whatsit

+ A lightweight, native desktop client for WhatsApp Web built with ~Qt 6~ and ~Qt WebEngine~, and is *NOT* Electron-based.

+ I have tried many Whatsapp web clients, but none of them are fast and light. None of them felt right...

+ My setup is Arch-KDE Plasma-Wayland. If your setup is similar, the app should work well.

+ In =v3.x.x=, additional features such as memory kill switch and custom app and tray icons, etc.
  You may call these features bloat, but I like to have those. If you don't want those, use lower versions of the app.

+ If you want the minimal and bare version, use =v1.0.1=. Tray icon and Notifications are implemented in =v2.0.0=.

** Features
+ Native: Qt 6 & Qt WebEngine-based
+ Persistent login and chat storage
+ Uses standard XDG directories
+ KDE / Wayland friendly
+ KDE Native Notification support
+ Reduce memory usage & kill switch
+ Opens whatsapp links from browsers to send messages.
