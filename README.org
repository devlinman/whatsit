* About Whatsit

+ A lightweight, native desktop client for WhatsApp Web built with ~Qt 6~ and ~Qt WebEngine~, and is *NOT* Electron-based.

+ Name Inspired by the series /Stranger Things S5/.

+ I have tried many Whatsapp web clients, but none of them are fast and light. None of them felt right...

+ My setup is Arch-KDE Plasma-Wayland. If your setup is similar, the app should work well.

+ In =v3.x.x=, additional features such as memory kill switch and custom app and tray icons, etc.
  You may call these features bloat, but I like to have those. If you don't want those, use lower versions of the app.

+ If you want the minimal and bare version, use =v1.0.1=. Tray icon and Notifications are implemented in =v2.0.0=.

** Features
+ Native: Qt 6 & Qt WebEngine-based
+ Persistent login and chat storage
+ Uses standard XDG directories
+ KDE / Wayland friendly
+ Dark mode support via injecting JS
+ KDE Native Notification support
+ Reduce memory usage & kill switch
+ Opens whatsapp links from browsers to send messages.

* Wiki & Documentation

+ Check the [[https://github.com/devlinman/whatsit/wiki][wiki docs]] for more information.

* Improvements in v 3.1.0
+ About section.
+ xdg-open whatsapp links in app when opened from any browser.

* Notes
+ *Some JavaScript is injected to make dark mode and notifications work.*

+ For =Prefer Dark Mode= toggle to work, you need to enable /dark theme/ in Whatsapp first.
  + Go to =Whatsapp Settings= -> =Chats= -> =Theme= and choose =Dark=.
  + If enabling the menu option is still breaking the view of the webpage, restart the app completely.

+ Notifications will only show when the app is minimized, hidden, or out of view (in a different virtual desktop).

+ If no Size parameter is set, the app defaults to =1200x800=.

+ If =MaximizeByDefault= key is set to "=true=", it overrides =RememberPreviousWindowSize= key.

+ No support for multiple accounts/profiles.

+ If you opt for =use Less Memory=, the webpage is temporarily closed. but the app remains in tray. CPU consumption will increase each time the app is opened and the webpage is loaded.

+ When =Memory Kill Switch= is activated and the threshold is chosen, the app checks for its own memory usage every =30= seconds.
