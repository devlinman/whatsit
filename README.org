* Whatsit

- A lightweight, native desktop client for WhatsApp Web built with Qt 6 and Qt WebEngine.

- whatsit is not Electron-based. It uses system Qt and WebEngine, resulting in significantly lower memory usage, faster startup, and proper KDE/Qt integration.

- Name Inspired by the series Stranger Things S5.

- I tried many Whatsapp web clients, but none of them are fast and light.
  I don't need a system tray... I don't need notifications...

* Features

- Native Qt 6 application
- Qt WebEngine-based (Chromium)
- Persistent login and chat storage
- Uses standard XDG directories
- KDE / Wayland friendly
- Dark mode support via configuration
- Very low overhead compared to Electron apps

* Storage Locations

- Config:
  =~/.config/whatsit/whatsit.conf=
- Data (cookies, IndexedDB, sessions):
  =~/.local/share/whatsit/=
- Cache:
  =~/.cache/whatsit/=

* Configuration

Currently supported options:

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[General]
PreferDarkMode=1
#+END_SRC

* Limitations

- No system tray integration
- No native notification support
- No account switching UI
- No custom theming UI
- WhatsApp Web only (no native WhatsApp protocol)

These are intentional to keep the application minimal and fast.

* Requirements

- Linux
- Qt >= 6.2
- qt6-base
- qt6-webengine
- CMake
- C++17 compatible compiler

* Build

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
./whatsit
#+END_SRC

* Philosophy

whatsit is designed to be:
- Fast
- Minimal
- Native
- Maintainable

It delegates all heavy lifting to Qt WebEngine and avoids unnecessary abstraction layers.
