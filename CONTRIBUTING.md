# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Quick Rules

* This is a C++ / Qt project — keep changes clean, focused, and consistent with the existing style.
* Keep things sane: small PRs, clear commits, minimal surprises.
* Follow Semantic Versioning rules.
* Ensure that the project builds and runs properly before pulling it into master.

## Projects
* Use the [Project](https://github.com/users/devlinman/projects/) created for this app to track your activity and that of others.
* Save time and energy. Don't waste time on something another person is working on. Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Once your issue has been put on the project board, you may be assigned to it.
* Ask for permission from the assignee to work on something that they are already working on.  

## Workflow

1. **Start from a new branch**

   * Never work directly on `main`.
   * Use a descriptive branch name.

2. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**

   * All changes must go through a PR.

3. **Confirm first**

   * Before starting work on any feature, fix, or PR, **check with the maintainer first**.

## Scope of Work

* Only work on issues or features **currently mentioned** in the project page.
* If something is not already listed:

  1. Open an issue first
  2. Get confirmation
  3. Then create a branch and PR

## Keep It Simple

* Follow existing project structure and Qt best practices.
* Avoid unnecessary refactors.
* Document behavior changes when needed.

Thanks for helping improve the project!

## Discussions
* Check the discussion page for topics.
* Start a new topic, if you want to. But keep it relevant.


# Signing

* It is recommended to sign your commits and PRs.

* Signing commits helps verify that changes were actually made by you, and not impersonated or altered in transit.  
It adds an extra layer of trust and accountability, especially for open-source projects.

* If you want to sign commits, you can configure Git with a GPG or SSH signing key. For example:

```
git commit -S -m "Your message"
```
* GitHub will then show your commit as Verified.

* This is optional, but encouraged for contributors submitting patches or long-term changes.
